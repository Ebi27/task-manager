# Task Manager App

This app is the first app that i am creating to solve a particular problem. This project is one that hits close to home and one day, i will tell it's story. This app is a project manager through which you can time yourself while working on a task, create goals and daily tasks and track all of your activities. 

I am taking the first big step to start this project 6 months after thinking of it and one month after mapping out an actual plan. I will continue to update this readme as i progress with it. I amcurrently still researching on what i want the UI to look like as well as working with what i already have. 

Alot of the tools i will be using to create this app, i will be learning along the line. I am one week into learning react and will be using my new knowledge as i continue to learn.. I am really excited about this one.
