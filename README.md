# Task Manager App

I struggled alot with managing my work, person, home & fitness tasks , staying focused on a particular thing thereby leading to procastination and this has happened all my life. I sought out help and also started working on how to make my life better, maximize my time by doing more. 

I came across two concepts; The 12-week year and the Pomodoro timer technique and will be building this app around these two techniques. . The idea is to break down all of your tasks into the tiniest bits and organize them in aless overwhelming way- which is why i am focusing on a minimalist UI design.

As much as the UI is a big part of this application, the backend is even bigger. While learning, I would frequently time myself, and knowing i would get a report at the end of the day made me want to do it even on lazy days. I never wanted an empty result at least.  

I believe everyday Is a new begining and you have an opportunity to start afresh every new day. Your days make your week, your weeks make your months, your months make your years and your years make your life and this is why it is important to be intentional about it. To be intentional about it, you need know these;
a) Align your thinking with actions 
b) You can perform at your best and achieve the life that matters to you by planning and executing 
c) Effective execution makes a difference and will set you apart 

Remember, You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do. 

With this application, you will be forced to confront your lack of execution. You will be able to focus on what drives income and life balance to help you define what you need today to achieve your long term gaol. It focuses on; 

- Personal Vision ( You will be able to define your life as you want to live all areas of it. Financial, personal, professional, self-care, fitness) 
- What your work/business needs to look like to achieve your personal vision.
- You will be able to create strategies to help you achieve them.
- You will be able to create your vision and stay connected with it. 

Breaking down your tasks and goals makes it easy to predict what your daily actions should be to achieve them. 

This app will offer you the opportunity to do all of these and more. Alot of the tools i will be using to create this app, i will be learning along the line. I am one week into learning react and will be using my new knowledge as i continue to learn.. I am really excited about this one.
